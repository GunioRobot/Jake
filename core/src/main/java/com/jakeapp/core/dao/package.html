<p>
This package contains all the classes used to access the database.
All the necessary methods are specified in the corresponding interfaces.
   </p>
<p>
    All the DAO's have a wrapper to execute the database code in an own thread,
    to prevent problems with Hibernate. This will hopefully be resolved in the
    future and the <code>Threaded***Dao</code>-Classes will be obsolete.
