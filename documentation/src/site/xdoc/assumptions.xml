    <section name="Assumptions">
	<p>This site acts a reference to all project related assumptions. In the upper part of the site you will find valid assumptions, categorised by their domain and scope. In the lower part you will find new, changed or assumptions that are currently under discussion and need approval by the team, or some team members.</p>
	<p>For the ease of use, each assumptions has an unique identifier [&lt;identifier&gt;]. This identifier should be short, simple and obvious. Once chosen it shall not be changed, and therefore be stable. If assumptions are refined, or otherwise hierarchically organised an identifier of the form [&lt;parent&gt;:&lt;child&gt;] shall be used.</p>
	<p>Discussion of Assumptions takes place at <a href="http://sepm.doublesignal.com/wiki/doku.php?id=assumptions">wiki/Assumptions</a></p>

					<td>[folder_structure] Folder structure of imported folders is preserved</td>

					<td>[project_folder] All shared data lies in one project folder</td>
					<td>simplifies implementation, transparency for the user</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Feature: [passive_mode] The application can be fully operational even without constant user interaction. That means that the client may passively share data and therefore acts as a dedicated server.</td>
					<td>limit the problem of unavailable clients and increase the chance of working with the latest files.</td>
					<td>scope of the application, architecture, user interaction</td>
				</tr>
				<tr> <!-- TODO: discuss, as not modeled so far -->
					<td>Feature: [soft_lock] Instad of implementing a strict access control systems a soft lock is used. If a user wants to update a file, he/she may be notified that access to the file is somehow restricted. After receiving the notification the user may decide to obey the restriction or not.</td>
					<td>no dead- or abandoned locks, no access control required</td>
					<td>scope of application, architecture</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[push_pull] Concept: Data may either be pushed to, or pulled from a client</td>
					<td>necessary for synchronization</td>
					<td>architecture</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[auto_push_pull] The user may indicate whether the application automatically or manually pushes/pulls data. This option may save bandwidth and gives the user more control over the traffic.</td>
					<td>save bandwidth, more control over traffic, restrict traffic in insecure environments</td>
					<td>scope of application, architecture</td>

					<td>[multi_platform] The application shall run under Windows, Linux and Mac Os X</td>

					<td>[single_project] The project is centered around handling one project. An instance of the application will only handle one project and data pertaining to different projects shall be stored in different database files.</td>
					<td>simplicity, doing one thing well, clear separation of different projects and simpler data model</td>
					<td>architecture, GUI</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>[no_chat] It is assumed that project members use a chat client next to the application. We don't want to replace the chat client and don't want to provide chat or group chat functionality. However, leaving a message for other project members (and displaying those) is a use case.</td>
					<td>Don't replace a chat client.</td>
