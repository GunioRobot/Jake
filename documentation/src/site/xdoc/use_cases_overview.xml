			and therefor cannot allow users to remove others from the project. Without rights management, this
			could lead to serious synchronization problems (e.g. user a deletes user c, user c adds a file to the project, user b pulls it and redistributes the log to a, but a doesn't know of c anymore -> invalid state.)
